# Call Harvey — Competitive Intelligence Report

**Date:** February 22, 2026  
**Prepared for:** CEO / Board  
**Classification:** Confidential

---

## Executive Summary

The AI voice agent market has exploded — 22% of YC's recent batch was voice AI companies — creating both intense competition and market validation for Call Harvey. The Dubai real estate market is uniquely positioned with **~29,500 registered brokers across ~7,900 agencies** (growing by 1,000 brokers/month), generating AED 3.2B+ in commissions H1 2025 alone. Call Harvey's closest direct competitor is **Brightcall.ai**, a UAE-based AI calling platform already integrated with PropSpace CRM and targeting Dubai real estate specifically. However, no competitor offers a purpose-built, <60-second response AI caller specifically designed for Dubai RE lead qualification with visa status and neighborhood-specific knowledge — this is Call Harvey's moat. At AED 349–1,999/mo, Call Harvey is priced **aggressively below** both human ISAs (~$2,000+/mo) and most AI platforms, which should accelerate adoption but may signal "cheap" to luxury-focused brokerages.

## 2. YC-Backed Voice AI Companies

| Company | YC Batch | Total Raised | Pricing | Target Market | RE Focus? |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Bland AI** | W24 | $65M (Series B) | $0.09/min + $299/mo base | Enterprise | No (general) |
| **Retell AI** | S23 | ~$4.5M+ | $0.07+/min, ~$350-400/mo effective | Enterprise contact centers | No (general) |
| **Vapi** | W24 | $20M (Series A) | $0.05/min platform + STT/TTS/LLM costs | Developers | No (general, but RE use cases exist) |
| **Bolna** | S24 | $6.3M (Seed) | Custom | India-focused enterprises | No (India multilingual) |

### Non-YC but Major Players

| Company | Total Raised | Pricing | Target Market | RE Focus? |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Synthflow** | ~$30M (Series A) | $0.08/min; plans from $29–$1,400/mo | SMBs, agencies | Yes (templates for RE) |
| **Air AI** | Bootstrapped (~$3.5M revenue) | Per-minute + upfront fee; enterprise $50K+ | Large enterprises | Yes (RE is key vertical) |

### Key Insight
Voice AI represented **22% of YC's W25 batch** (per a16z/Cartesia). The infrastructure layer (Vapi, Retell, Bland) is commoditizing fast. The value is shifting to **vertical-specific applications** — exactly where Call Harvey sits.

## 3. Real Estate AI Callers / ISA Replacements

### 3.1 Brightcall.ai — PRIMARY COMPETITOR ⚠️

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **HQ** | UAE-based |
| **Funding** | Undisclosed (bootstrapped/small rounds) |
| **Positioning** | "Top AI Voice Agent in Dubai" — explicitly targets UAE RE |

| **Strengths** | Already in UAE market, PropSpace integration, Arabic support, established brand |
| **Weaknesses** | Generic platform (not RE-specific logic), no public RE-qualification framework, appears more as contact center than ISA replacement |

**Threat Level: HIGH** — They're already in Dubai, already integrated with PropSpace, and already marketing to real estate. However, they appear to be a general-purpose AI calling platform rather than a purpose-built RE lead qualifier.

### 3.2 Ylopo AI

| **Threat to Harvey** | LOW (US-only, expensive) |

### 3.5 CINC (Commissions Inc)

| Attribute | Details |

| **AI Features** | CINC AI add-on for text-based nurturing |
| **Pricing** | $1,000+/mo (custom, includes ad spend) |
| **Threat to Harvey** | LOW (US-only, no voice AI calling) |

### 3.6 Lofty (formerly Chime)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Type** | All-in-one RE platform |
| **Pricing** | Starting $449/mo + add-ons |
| **AI Features** | AI Copilot, power dialer, automated follow-up, AI workflow builder |

### 3.7 Follow Up Boss

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Type** | RE CRM with calling features |
| **AI Features** | Built-in AI for call summaries, integrates with third-party AI callers (Ace AI, Mod AI) |

## 4. Dubai/UAE Market Specifics

### 4.1 Market Size

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Registered brokers | **~29,500** (as of H1 2025) | Dubai Land Department |
| Brokerage offices | **~7,900** | The National (May 2025) |
| New brokers entering/month | **~1,000** | The National (Nov 2025) |
| H1 2025 broker commissions | **AED 3.23 billion** ($879M) | DLD Media Office |
| Average monthly commission/broker | **AED 18,000** (~$4,900) | The National |
| H1 2025 broker-facilitated transactions | **42,181** | DLD |
| UAE PropTech market (2024) | **AED 2.2B** ($600M) | Research and Markets |
| UAE PropTech market (2030 projected) | **AED 5.7B** ($1.5B) | Research and Markets |

### 4.2 Key Platforms & CRMs Used in Dubai

| Platform | Role | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **PropSpace** | #1 RE CRM in UAE | Dubai's longest-running RE CRM; listings, leads, deals. **Critical integration target.** |
| **Property Finder** | Lead generation portal | Major listing portal; no AI calling features |
| **Bayut** | Lead generation portal | Launched BayutGPT (text-based property search AI); no outbound calling |
| **Dubizzle** | Classifieds/listings | Part of EMPG group with Bayut |
| **GoHighLevel** | Marketing automation CRM | Growing in UAE; Brightcall already integrated |

### 4.3 Bayut & Property Finder — AI Capabilities

- **Bayut**: Launched **BayutGPT** (Sep 2023) — conversational property search assistant. Text-based, consumer-facing. **No outbound calling to leads.**
- **Property Finder**: Focus on listing quality, search UX, and agent tools. **No AI calling features.**
- **Neither portal is doing AI outbound calling** — they generate leads and hand them off. This is Call Harvey's insertion point.

### 4.4 Dubai Land Department / RERA Tech Initiatives

- **PropTech Connect** — annual conference (Feb 2026) focused on RE innovation
- **REES** (Real Estate Evolution System) — digital framework for transactions
- **Blockchain title deeds** and e-mortgages already implemented
- **Dubai PropTech Hub** at DIFC — incubator/accelerator for proptech startups ($300M investment)
- **AI Seal of Excellence** from Dubai Centre for AI (Prop-AI was first recipient)
- **Sandbox Dubai** — regulatory sandbox encouraging proptech experimentation

### 4.5 UAE-Specific Considerations

- **WhatsApp is king**: 79.6% of UAE internet users use WhatsApp — it's the primary communication channel for RE agents and clients
- **Multilingual market**: Arabic, English, Hindi, Urdu, Russian, Chinese — agents deal with extremely diverse clientele
- **Visa-linked property**: Golden Visa (AED 2M+ property), investor visas — qualification MUST include visa eligibility
- **Off-plan dominance**: Major portion of Dubai transactions are off-plan; AI needs to understand payment plans, handover timelines
- **Commission structure**: Typically 2% buyer side; agents are highly motivated by speed-to-lead

## 5. Adjacent Players

### 5.1 General AI Calling Platforms

| Platform | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Orum** | ~$250/user/mo | AI-powered parallel dialer; assists human reps, doesn't replace them |
| **Nooks** | ~$100-150/user/mo ($4K/yr) | Virtual sales floor + parallel dialer; human-in-the-loop |
| **Dialpad AI** | $95-170/user/mo | Business phone system with AI; not autonomous calling |
| **Salesloft** | Enterprise pricing | Sales engagement platform; AI assists, doesn't replace |

**Key difference**: These are **human augmentation** tools (help reps dial faster). Call Harvey is a **human replacement** tool (AI makes the call autonomously). Different category entirely.

### 5.2 Human ISA Services — Pricing Benchmark

| Service | Monthly Cost | Model |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Verse.ai** | ~$1,800+/mo | AI + human hybrid |
| **Conversion Monsters** | ~$795+/mo | Dedicated human ISA |
| **Virtual ISA (offshore)** | ~$1,500-2,000/mo | Part-time human caller |
| **In-house ISA (US)** | $3,000-5,000/mo + commission | Full-time employee |
| **In-house ISA (Dubai)** | AED 5,000-10,000/mo + commission | Full-time employee |

**Call Harvey at AED 349-1,999 replaces AED 5,000-10,000+/mo human ISA costs — a clear 3-10x cost advantage.**

### 5.3 WhatsApp Business API Platforms in UAE

Key providers: **SleekFlow**, **Wacto**, **WebMaxy**, **WappBiz**, **Green Ads Global**, **Happilee**

WhatsApp integration is **table stakes** for Dubai RE. Most agents communicate with clients primarily via WhatsApp. Call Harvey MUST integrate with WhatsApp for:
- Post-call summary sent to lead via WhatsApp
- WhatsApp-based appointment confirmations
- Agent notification via WhatsApp when lead is qualified

### 5.4 Lead Generation Platforms for Dubai RE

| Platform | Type |
|----------|------|
| Property Finder | Portal leads |
| Bayut / Dubizzle | Portal leads |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads | Social media leads |
| Google Ads | Search leads |
| Project developer leads | Off-plan handouts |

---

## 6. SWOT Analysis for Call Harvey

### Strengths
- **<60 second response time** — proven to dramatically increase conversion rates
- **Dubai-specific qualification** (visa status, neighborhood, budget in AED, timeline, off-plan vs ready)
- **Purpose-built for RE** — not a generic voice platform
- **Price point** — 3-10x cheaper than human ISA
- **Modern stack** (Pipecat + Deepgram + GPT-4o + ElevenLabs) — best-in-class components
- **No-code for the agent** — they just get qualified leads and booked showings

### Weaknesses
- **No PropSpace integration yet** — Brightcall already has this
- **No Arabic language support** (presumably) — critical for UAE market
- **Early stage** — no brand recognition vs Brightcall's established UAE presence
- **WhatsApp integration** — unclear if this exists yet
- **Single market dependency** (Dubai)

### Opportunities
- **No incumbent does exactly this** — purpose-built AI cold caller for Dubai RE
- **27,000+ brokers**, growing 1,000/month — massive addressable market
- **Average broker earns AED 18K/mo** — AED 349-1,999 is very affordable
- **PropTech Hub / DLD backing** — government support for proptech innovation
- **Off-plan developer partnerships** — developers could bundle Call Harvey for their agent networks
- **Expansion to Saudi Arabia** — similar market dynamics, even larger

### Threats
- **Brightcall.ai** — already in UAE, already has PropSpace integration, already marketing to RE
- **Platform players going vertical** — Synthflow, Retell, Bland could launch RE-specific templates
- **Bayut/Property Finder** — could build native AI calling into their platforms
- **Regulatory risk** — UAE telecom regulations on automated calling (TRA compliance)
- **Agent resistance** — "AI will replace me" fear from the 29,500 brokers
- **Race to bottom** — well-funded competitors (Bland: $65M, Vapi: $20M) could undercut

## 7. Pricing Analysis

### 7.1 Call Harvey vs Market

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Cost per Qualified Lead (est.) |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Call Harvey Starter** | AED 349 (~$95) | Depends on volume |
| **Call Harvey Pro** | AED 1,999 (~$544) | Depends on volume |
| **Human ISA (Dubai)** | AED 5,000-10,000 (~$1,360-2,720) | AED 200-500 |
| **Brightcall.ai** | ~$80/user/mo (~AED 294) | Unknown |
| **Synthflow** | $29-1,400/mo | $0.08/min |
| **Ylopo AI Voice** | ~$500/mo add-on | US-only |
| **Verse.ai** | ~$1,800/mo | US-only |
| **Bland AI (DIY)** | $299/mo + $0.09/min | Developer required |

### 7.2 Pricing Assessment

**Are we too cheap?**
- At AED 349/mo (~$95), possibly yes for the **starter tier** — it's cheaper than Brightcall and may signal "toy" to serious brokerages
- At AED 1,999/mo (~$544), well-positioned against human ISAs and premium enough for value perception

**Recommendation:**
- Consider **3 tiers**: AED 499 / AED 999 / AED 1,999 (or AED 2,499)
- Lowest tier should be above AED 400 to avoid "cheap" perception in Dubai's luxury-oriented market
- Top tier should include unlimited calls + priority support + WhatsApp integration
- Consider **per-lead pricing** option: AED 15-25 per qualified lead (popular model in RE)
- Consider **commission-based pilot**: free tool, take AED 500 per closed deal from Harvey-qualified leads (alignment of incentives)

## 9. Go-to-Market Insights — Dubai Specific

### 9.1 Distribution Strategy

1. **PropSpace partnership** — Get listed in PropSpace marketplace/integrations. This is the #1 channel.
2. **Developer partnerships** — Approach Emaar, DAMAC, Sobha, Nakheel. Offer Call Harvey as a value-add for their agent networks.
3. **Brokerage-first, not agent-first** — Sell to brokerage owners (7,900 firms). They can mandate adoption across 5-50 agents each.
4. **RERA/DLD PropTech Hub** — Apply to Dubai PropTech Hub accelerator for credibility + DLD connections.
5. **Property Finder/Bayut partnership** — Position as their "lead activation" layer. They generate leads; Harvey converts them.

### 9.2 Key Sales Arguments for Dubai Agents

- "Your lead from Property Finder costs AED 50-200. If you don't call within 5 minutes, 78% won't pick up later. Harvey calls in 60 seconds."
- "You're paying AED 8,000/mo for an ISA who works 8 hours. Harvey works 24/7 for AED 1,999."
- "Harvey qualifies Golden Visa eligibility on the first call, so you know the buyer's budget before you pick up the phone."

### 9.3 Pricing for Dubai

Dubai agents think in terms of ROI per lead. One closed deal = AED 40,000-200,000+ commission. If Harvey helps close even ONE extra deal per year, it's paid for itself 20-100x over.

**Recommended pricing:**
| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Solo Agent** | AED 499/mo | 200 calls/mo, basic qualification, WhatsApp alerts |
| **Team** | AED 1,499/mo | 1,000 calls/mo, PropSpace integration, Arabic + English, live transfer |
| **Brokerage** | AED 3,999/mo | Unlimited calls, all languages, priority support, custom scripts, API access |

### 9.4 Potential Partnerships

| Partner | Type | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| **PropSpace** | CRM Integration | Access to 2,000+ brokerages |
| **Property Finder** | Lead Source Integration | Auto-import leads for instant calling |
| **Bayut** | Lead Source Integration | Auto-import leads |
| **Emaar/DAMAC/Sobha** | Developer Partnership | Bundle with off-plan agent networks |
| **SleekFlow / WebMaxy** | WhatsApp Integration | Post-call WhatsApp automation |
| **GoHighLevel** | CRM Integration | Growing in UAE market |

---

## 10. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Brightcall builds RE-specific features | HIGH | HIGH | Move fast; lock in PropSpace integration first |
| Bayut/PF build native AI calling | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Partner with them before they build in-house |
| UAE telecom regulation on AI calls | MEDIUM | HIGH | Get legal opinion on TRA rules for automated calling; ensure disclosure |
| Bland/Vapi/Retell launch RE templates | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Vertical depth (visa, off-plan, neighborhoods) is hard to replicate quickly |
| Agent resistance to AI | HIGH | MEDIUM | Position as "AI assistant" not "AI replacement"; lead with ROI data |
| Price war from funded competitors | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Win on vertical depth, not price; lock in annual contracts |
| Data privacy (DIFC/ADGM regulations) | LOW | HIGH | Ensure GDPR-equivalent compliance; data residency in UAE |

| Feature | Call Harvey | Brightcall.ai | Ylopo AI | Synthflow | Bland AI | Retell AI |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|

---

## 12. Key Takeaways & Recommendations

1. **Speed is everything.** Brightcall is the biggest threat and is already in-market. PropSpace integration and Arabic support are urgent.

2. **WhatsApp is non-negotiable.** In Dubai RE, if you can't send a WhatsApp, you don't exist. Post-call WhatsApp summary to both agent and lead is a must.

3. **Position as "AI ISA for Dubai"** — not "AI calling platform." The vertical positioning is the moat. Every feature should reinforce Dubai RE expertise.

4. **Price slightly higher.** AED 349 feels too cheap for Dubai's luxury market. AED 499 minimum entry sends a better signal. Top tier at AED 2,499-3,999 for brokerages.

5. **Partner before they build.** Property Finder and Bayut will eventually build AI calling. Partner NOW while they're focused on search/listing. Be their calling layer.

6. **Arabic is P0, not P1.** 30%+ of leads will be Arabic-speaking. Launch without Arabic and you lose credibility with UAE brokerages.

7. **Developer channel is a goldmine.** Emaar alone has thousands of off-plan agents. One developer partnership = hundreds of users overnight.

8. **Get into PropTech Hub.** DLD's PropTech Hub gives credibility, connections, and regulatory air cover. Apply immediately.
